Below is the updated **Setup.md** file. This version is more comprehensive and includes details on the complete project structure, including separate files for routes, agents, and other modules that require content. Each file is described with its purpose and includes a placeholder section where developers can add or update content.

# Setup.md

This document provides instructions for setting up the Omega-AGI FastAPI project on a development machine or server. It covers the project structure, environment configuration, dependency installation, and steps to run the application. Following these steps will ensure you have all the required components in place to start the system.

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows (directory names and files):

```
OmegaAGI/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py               # FastAPI application instance and route definitions.
│   ├── agent.py              # Implementation of the OmegaAgent class (agent logic).
│   ├── model_provider.py     # Functions/classes to integrate with LLM APIs (OpenAI, etc.).
│   ├── db.py                 # Database (Supabase) client setup and logging functions.
│   ├── models.py             # Pydantic data models for requests and responses (OmegaRequest, OmegaResponse, etc.).
│   ├── routes/               # Directory containing separate route files for modularity.
│   │   ├── omega_routes.py       # Routes for Omega execution, validation, correction, reflection, improvement.

```

### Description of Key Components

- **app/main.py:**  
  Constructs the FastAPI application instance, mounts route modules (from `app/routes/`), and ties together agents, models, and the database.

- **app/agent.py:**  
  Contains the `OmegaAgent` class, which handles parsing the Omega prompt, validating its structure, and orchestrating calls to LLMs for processing, reflection, and correction.

- **app/model_provider.py:**  
  Abstracts the LLM calls (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) into functions such as:
  - `call_translator_llm_human_to_omega()`
  - `call_translator_llm_omega_to_human()`
  - `call_translator_llm_correction()`
  - `call_reflection_llm()`
  
  Each function includes detailed instructions and pseudocode.

- **app/db.py:**  
  Sets up the Supabase client and defines functions (e.g., `log_interaction()`) for logging requests and responses.

- **app/models.py:**  
  Contains all the Pydantic models for request and response validation. Models include OmegaRequest, OmegaResponse, HumanToOmegaRequest, OmegaValidationRequest, etc.

- **app/routes/:**  
  This folder holds separate route files to keep code modular and best practice size:
  - **omega_routes.py:** Handles endpoints for `/api/v1/omega` (execution, validation, correction, reflection, and improvement).
  - **human_to_omega_routes.py:** Contains endpoints for human-to-Omega conversion (LLM-based and parser-based).
  - **omega_to_human_routes.py:** Contains the endpoint for translating Omega to human language.
  - **reasoning_routes.py:** Contains the reasoning endpoint.
  - **agent_routes.py:** Contains the endpoint to process Omega through specific agents.
  - **logs_routes.py:** (Optional) Contains the logs retrieval endpoint for admin usage.

- **app/config.py:**  
  Loads configuration settings using dspy from a `.env` file. This centralizes API keys and configuration values.

- **plan/:**  
  Contains planning documents. For example, the Implementation_Plan.md outlines the full development plan, milestones, and tasks.

- **tests/:**  
  Placeholder folder for unit and integration tests.

- **requirements.txt:**  
  Lists all Python package dependencies (e.g., fastapi, uvicorn, openai, supabase-python, python-dotenv).

- **setup.sh:**  
  A shell script to automate environment setup (detailed below).

- **.env.example:**  
  A template file for environment configuration. Copy this to `.env` and update with actual values.

---

## Environment Configuration

The application requires configuration values provided via environment variables. These include:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – Your OpenAI API key for LLM access.
- `SUPABASE_URL` – The URL of your Supabase project.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` – The service role API key for your Supabase project.
- `DEFAULT_MODEL` – (optional) Default model identifier (e.g., "openai-gpt4").
- `MODEL_PROVIDER` – (optional) The model provider name (e.g., "openai" or "google").
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` – (optional) Token for admin endpoints (e.g., logs retrieval).
- `MAX_CORRECTION_ATTEMPTS` – (optional) Maximum allowed correction iterations (e.g., 3).

Create a `.env` file at the project root (copy from `.env.example`) with these variables. For example:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key
DEFAULT_MODEL=openai-gpt4
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
ADMIN_TOKEN=change-this-for-production
MAX_CORRECTION_ATTEMPTS=3
```

Do not commit your actual `.env` file to version control.

## Dependency Installation

1. **Create Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   With `requirements.txt` in place, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, manually install:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] openai supabase-python python-dotenv pydantic
   ```

   Additional packages (e.g., pytest, flake8, black) may be installed as needed.

---

## Supabase Setup

- Create a Supabase project via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
- Use the SQL editor to create the `query_logs` table with columns:
  - `id` (bigserial, primary key)
  - `prompt` (text)
  - `response` (text)
  - `model` (varchar(50))
  - `created_at` (timestamp, default now())
- Retrieve the Supabase URL and service key, and set them in your `.env`.

---

## Running the Application

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**

   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/health` to confirm the server is running.
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive API documentation.
   - Test endpoints using curl or via the Swagger UI.

## Placeholders and Modular Files

Each file that requires content (such as route files and agent files) includes placeholders where you can expand functionality:

- **app/main.py:**  
  Should import and mount routes from the `app/routes/` folder.

- **app/routes/omega_routes.py:**  
  Should contain routes for `/api/v1/omega` and related endpoints (validation, correction, reflection, improvement). Place a placeholder comment like `# TODO: Implement Omega execution logic`.

- **app/routes/human_to_omega_routes.py:**  
  Contains endpoints for human-to-omega conversion. Include placeholders.

- **app/routes/omega_to_human_routes.py:**  
  Contains the endpoint for translating Omega to human language.

- **app/routes/reasoning_routes.py:**  
  Contains the reasoning endpoint.

- **app/routes/agent_routes.py:**  
  Contains endpoints to process Omega via specific agents.

- **app/routes/logs_routes.py:**  
  (Optional) Contains the logs retrieval endpoint.

- **app/agent.py, app/model_provider.py, app/db.py, app/models.py:**  
  Each file includes basic implementations with comments and placeholders where further logic can be added.

---

## Project Maintenance

- **Updating Dependencies:**  
  Modify `requirements.txt` and reinstall as needed.

- **Running Tests:**  
  Use `pytest` for test cases placed under the `tests/` directory.

- **Common Issues:**  
  - Ensure you run uvicorn from the project root so that the `app` package is found.
  - Update the `.env` file with actual credentials.
  - If the server doesn't start, check for syntax or import errors in the terminal.

By following this setup guide, you should have a fully working instance of the Omega-AGI system. The structure supports modular development, making it easier to manage separate endpoints and agent logic as the project evolves.

Happy coding!
